Rock paper scissor game coded with codecademy's help

This Rock, Paper, Scissor game was coded with JavaScript and was part of codecademy's 'Freedom Project'.

They instruct you on what you need to code first, sencond and so forth to complete the project.

Codecademy has a hint tag during the project but one should try to code the project on their own before checking.
